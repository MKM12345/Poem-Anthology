                <p>
                    Oh I love English so much,<br>

Love it so much,<br>

Yes, so very much,<br>

Love it, Love it, Love it,<br>

I love it so much.<br>

 <br>

How the teacher drone on & on,<br>

Loquaciously talking about their son,<br>

Yes, I find it so interesting,<br>

The vast amount of piling homework,<br>

Turning my eyes red,<br>

  <br>

How my attention wavers,<br>

I look out the window,<br>

Slowly scanning the area,<br>

I see a bird, oooh! Pretty!<br>

And notice every feature for the next 20 minutes,<br>

 <br>

Oh yes, I find it interesting,<br>

So very much,<br>

I love it so much,<br>

I feel like my heads gonna explode.<br>

And my insides gonna cook inside.<br>

 <br>

The stacked-up buildings of paper,<br>

Oh very good, very good, indeed,<br>

I look at the everlasting tower,<br>

My eyes straining to see the top,<br>

I’m gonna need to buy a flamethrower soon.<br>

 <br>

“Oh”, the teacher says,<br>

“Come back for extra revision at lunch”, <br>

“Cool”, I mutter,<br>

I’d love to come,<br>

But I have urgent business in the football pitch,<br>

So I have to rush!<br>

Maybe next time”.<br>

                <h4>Grr...Pen Ink.</h4>
                <p>
                    Why does my pen ink run out so quickly?<br>
I write an essay with and it runs out,<br>
Why is the quality so sickly?<br>
Even when I write a small story route!<br>
<br>
The refills my poor dad has to buy,<br>

It cost him a fortune!<br>

Even if it’s a parker pen- oh my! <br>

For just a few notes and homework in my room <br>

 <br>

The top is dented for uncapping the pen again and again, <br>

The boring motions is the norm,<br>

Even if the window shows a bored hen, <br>

I can’t even finish a form,<br>

<br>

The vast amount of energy use,<br>

Just because the pen can’t write.<br>

Even if my mum offers her award-winning moose, <br>

It does nothing to my pounding fright.<br>

 <br>

So what do we stand for:<br>

GIVE GOOD PENS! <br>

What do we stand for:<br>

KICK FAT HENS!<br>

What do we stand for:<br>

MAKE IT LAST LONGER!<br>

What do we want it for: <br>

TO MAKE US STRONGER!<br>

                <h4>Dead ends</h4>
                <p>
                    At the dawn of night,<br>
                    A mournful sight,<br>
                    Remembering dead friends,<br>
                    The soldiers sit around a campfire, sitting in dead ends.<br>
                    <br>
                    But the camp gets attacked and maimed,<br>
                    Muskets fire to the warriors of famed,<br>
                    Tanks come to give a hand, <br>
                    As they make their last stand.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now they are all dead. <br>
                    Hounds of the enemy fed,<br>
                    But there is a glimmer of hope,<br>
                    As reinforcements come down the slope.<br>
                    <br>
                    A massive phalanx of troops,<br>
                    Their presence makes the enemy swoop,<br>
                    Yelling war cries and banging of drums,<br>
                    The army kills the enemy in a chant of hums.<br>
                    <br>
                    As they leave no one alive,<br>
                    They march in one massive bee hive,<br>
                    They go to celebrate,<br>
                    Rejoicing the enemies fate,<br>
                    <br>
                    First they dance slowly,<br>
                    Keeping their gaze lowly,<br>
                    Then they get animated,<br>
                    Their dances fated.<br>
                    <br>
                    A mix of happy and sad sound,<br>
                    Their break finally found,<br>
                    As they remember their dead friends,<br>
                    This time, though, in no dead ends.

                <p>
                    The sweet smell wafted up my nose,<br>
                    As the percy pig stayed for a pose.<br>
                    Worse then my brothers cavities, the smell,<br>
                    Sent my skull reverberating like a bell.<br>
                    <br>
                    I gently smushed it in my palm,<br>
                    It felt like sheep's wool in a farm,<br>
                    A cloud so high in the sky,<br>
                    The joy there - oh my.<br>
                    <br>
                    I looked - a pause in time.<br>
                    I can't think of a suitable rhyme.<br>
                    A look of simple simplicity,<br>
                    Not a speck of any hidden atrocity,<br>
                    <br>
                    Ah, yes! The time I have been waiting for,<br>
                    As soon as I put one in my mouth, I wanted more,<br>
                    The juicy, strwberry taste, flooded my glands,<br>
                    I even started licking my hands!<br>
                    <br>
                    Like a gummy bear, rubbery and so nice,<br>
                    Even sweeter then sweet-chicken rice!<br>
                    Filling light in the hall of dark,<br>
                    The delicious taste left a profound mark.
